bc. $ sudo docker build -t <you-image-name-here> .

h2. File permissions on host

On *nix hosts you can set the container www-data user with the your current user and group ID to have write permissions on a docker volume. Just create a .env file in the project root with you IDs and build the image.

bc. USER_ID=1000
GROUP_ID=1000
